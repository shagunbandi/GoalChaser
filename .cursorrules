# Cursor Rules for Goal Chaser

## Code Organization Principles

### 1. Single Responsibility - One File, One Purpose
- **Components**: Each React component should have its own dedicated file
- **Types/Interfaces**: Keep in dedicated `types/` or `types.ts` files
- **Constants**: Store in dedicated `constants/` or `constants.ts` files
- **Utilities**: Helper functions go in `utils/` or `lib/` directory
- **API calls**: All API/Firebase calls should be in dedicated files under `lib/` or `api/`
- **Hooks**: Custom hooks should each have their own file in `hooks/`

### 2. File Structure Convention
```
src/
├── app/                    # Next.js app router pages
│   └── [route]/
│       └── page.tsx        # Page component (minimal, imports from components)
├── components/
│   ├── ui/                 # Reusable UI primitives (Card, Button, Tabs, etc.)
│   └── features/           # Feature-specific components (Calendar, DetailView, etc.)
├── hooks/                  # Custom React hooks
├── lib/                    # Utilities, API clients, Firebase helpers
├── types/                  # TypeScript type definitions
└── constants/              # App-wide constants
```

### 3. Component Guidelines
- Keep components under 150 lines when possible
- If a component exceeds 200 lines, consider splitting it
- Extract repeated JSX patterns into reusable components
- Use composition over large monolithic components

### 4. Naming Conventions
- **Components**: PascalCase (`Calendar.tsx`, `DetailView.tsx`)
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix (`useFirebase.ts`, `useGoals.ts`)
- **Utils**: camelCase (`dateUtils.ts`, `formatters.ts`)
- **Types**: PascalCase for types, interfaces (`DayDetails`, `GoalProps`)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for values (`WEEKDAY_LABELS`, `MONTH_NAMES`)

### 5. Import Organization
```typescript
// 1. React/Next imports
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'

// 2. Third-party libraries
import { motion } from 'framer-motion'

// 3. Internal absolute imports (components, hooks, utils)
import { Card } from '@/components/ui/Card'
import { useGoals } from '@/hooks/useGoals'
import { formatDate } from '@/lib/dateUtils'

// 4. Types
import type { DayDetails, GoalProps } from '@/types'

// 5. Relative imports (if any)
import { LocalComponent } from './LocalComponent'
```

### 6. Export Guidelines
- Use named exports for components (easier to refactor)
- Default exports only for page components (Next.js requirement)
- Re-export from index files for cleaner imports

### 7. Don'ts
- ❌ Don't put multiple components in one file (unless tightly coupled and small)
- ❌ Don't mix API logic with component logic
- ❌ Don't inline large constant arrays in components
- ❌ Don't duplicate types across files
- ❌ Don't write helper functions inside components if they can be pure utilities
